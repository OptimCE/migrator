-- Migration: 2026-08-20 — add geolocation columns to address.
--
-- The map views (meters as pins, communities as commune zones) need a point per
-- address. `address` is the shared entity behind meters, members, users and the
-- community headquarters, so the columns live here rather than on `meter`: one
-- change plots all four.
--
-- `geocode_status` is the work queue, not decoration:
--   0 NEVER      — never attempted; picked up by POST /geocoding/backfill
--   1 OK         — latitude/longitude are set
--   2 NOT_FOUND  — the geocoders ran and matched nothing
--   3 ERROR      — the geocoders ran and failed (retryable)
-- `geo_precision` records HOW good the point is (1 MANUAL, 2 ROOFTOP, 3 STREET,
-- 4 MUNICIPALITY) so the UI can render an approximate pin differently and the
-- backfill knows which rows are worth upgrading.
--
-- The closing UPDATE seeds a municipality centroid for every address whose
-- postcode maps to exactly ONE commune. That makes the map non-empty the moment
-- this lands, with no network call. Postcodes spanning several communes (1000,
-- 1040, 1050 ...) are deliberately left at status 0: averaging two centroids
-- would produce a point that is between both communes and in neither, which
-- looks authoritative and is wrong. The geocoder resolves those from `city`.
--
-- Notes:
--   * The backfill reads `municipality_postal_code` and `municipality.geo_point`
--     — created by migration 002, populated by 003. Version order is what makes
--     that safe: a database below 3 receives 002 and 003 first, in this same
--     run. A database whose `municipality` is empty matches nothing and leaves
--     every address at status 0, which is a no-op rather than a failure.
--   * The columns, both CHECKs and the partial index are also folded into
--     `crm-backend/database_script/init.sql`, so a fresh install and a migrated
--     install converge. On a database built from that init.sql every DDL
--     statement here is a no-op and only the UPDATE does work.
--   * `AND a.geocode_status = 0` is what makes the UPDATE replay-safe: a re-run
--     never overwrites a point a geocoder — or a human — has since produced.
--   * The UPDATE touches every not-yet-geocoded address in one statement, inside
--     the runner's transaction, holding row locks on `address` until it commits.
--     That is a maintenance-window operation, not a live-traffic one.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.
